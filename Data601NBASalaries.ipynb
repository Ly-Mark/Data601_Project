    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of our exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be on the salaries of athletes in the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n",
    "In exploring this data, we hope to examine how total salaries are divided amongst the teams and the allocation amongst players within certain teams.\n",
    "The earnings of top athletes are frequently addressed in the media and our team would like to explore the magnitude of the pay gap between top-performing teams\n",
    "and the best individual athletes relative to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The salaries of athletes draw attention due to the announcement of large contracts for star players.\n",
    "Our team will provide an illustration of how these salaries have changed over the past 20 years. We will also visually explore how salaries paid may be linked\n",
    "to the overall success of a team to determine whether higher pay truly drives better performance. We will also visually compare and contrast the salaries of\n",
    "players in different positions to better understand team composition and considerations for future team formation.\n",
    "## Guiding Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. How are the salaries of NBA players divided amongst the teams in the league and amongst the players within these teams?**\n",
    "\n",
    " In exploring this question, we would like to look at the allocation of the salaries in the league overall and examine some constituent\n",
    " teams, some containing star power and others which do not. In doing so, we would like to identify how the allocations\n",
    " differ when there are star players on a team.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Is there a significant correlation between the salaries paid and the success of a team?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This question would assist in determining whether higher pay leads to better performance and if the ability for a\n",
    "team to succeed is dependent on the salaries paid.In exploring this relationship, it may be possible to better understand\n",
    "if pay is a critical driver for performance and whether the ability to pay higher salaries contributes to higher rates of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. How are player salaries related to the position played? How have these changed over time?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring these questions will identify if certain positions are more highly valued and provide insight into how\n",
    "team compositions may change over time.Understanding which roles are paid the most provides insight into the evolution of\n",
    "how the game of basketball is played and which positions require the most attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "ESPN publishes NBA player salaries from 1990 to 2021. This page is organized in a structured table with headings for\n",
    "Rank, Name, Position, Team and Salary (USD). We will build and use a web scraper to pull this data into the same columns\n",

    "Walt Disney Company outlined here https://disneytermsofuse.com/english/#Usage-Rules\n",

    "Rank, Team, Salary (USD), and Salary adjusted for inflation (USD) using the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistic.\n",
    "Again, we will be scraping by building a web scraper and export each year into CSV files. We will be stitching the\n",
    "multiple CSV files into a single one and wrangle the data usable for data analysis. To use this data, we will consent to the terms of\n",
    "use outline by USA Today found here https://cm.usatoday.com/terms\n",
    "\n",
    "For any additional player and game information we will be using the website basketball-reference.com. The information\n",
    "provided on this website is organized into structured tables which can be scraped if needed. Player data is separated\n",
    "into Regular season and a Playoff table with 30 columns that include different counting stats during a basketball game.\n",
    "These tables are available to download in a CSV format. Specifically, we will be using the team rating table, and the win and lose columns\n",
    "in order to answer our second guiding question.\n",

    "\n",
    "For player data we will be using the csv file that was scraped from the ESPN website. This player data contains has columns for\n",
    "the players rank, name, position, team, salary (USD) and season. The data is already tidy, however we will need to further subset\n",
    "our data into individual player positions to explore the relationship between player salary and player position.\n",
    "1. First, we will check for any missing data using a heatmap from the seaborn package. Any missing values would have showed up as a yellow line.\n",
    "2. For our analysis we only need to keep 4 columns; Name, Position, Salary, and Season.\n",
    "3. Next, we will be making 7 subsets of our data for each position found in our original data set (position)\n",
    "  * Center (C), Power Forward (PF), Small Forward (SF), Shooting Guard (SG), Point Guard (PG), Forward (F),\n",
    "and Guard (G).\n",
    "    * There are 2 other positions that were omitted which were Shooting Guard and Small forward (GF) and NA.\n",
    "These positions were only made up 57 of these players out of the 10476 total. We could have arbitrarily assigned the GF to either an SG or SF if\n",
    "there were more of those designations in the dataset.\n",
    "    * The NA's span from the 2002 season to the 2013 and have players\n",
    "that may have been demoted to the NBA-G which is their minor league or the NBA-D league for their development league during\n",
    "the season. Other reasons for these NA designations could be retirement, injuries or signings to international teams.\n",
    "  * Created a function called makeSub, which creates a subset using *Pandas* operations\n",
    "    * cPosition, pfPosition, sfPosition, sgPosition, pgPosition, fPosition, gPosition\n",
    "4. To summarize our data, we will want to take the mean and median over all the salary columns.\n",
    "  * For the mean, we created a function that groups all the players salaries by season and then computes the mean for that season. Afterwards it renames the column as mean salary.\n",
    "  * For the median, we created another function that groups all players by salaries by season and then takes the median. We added a second column to the data set and called it median salary.\n",
    "  * We reset our index after to flatten our datasets back to a 2d data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After working with our data, we noticed some interesting results in the 2005 season. After looking at the data again, we noticed\n",
    "that the ESPN website we pulled the data from only had information on 120 players when there should be upwards of 450 players.\n",
    "To remedy this, we had to append our position data set, with data collection from hyperhoops.com and basketball-reference.com\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reading and cleaning the data\n",
    "  * This includes searching for NaN rows and removing them\n",
    "  * Converting numerical values in the dataset to integers to match our existing dataset\n",
    "  * Renaming the 'players' column to 'name'\n",
    "2. Formatting data set to match our existing dataset\n",
    "  * Dropping the adjusted salary column which was not used in our original dataset\n",
    "  * Reorganizing the columns to match our original data set (name, position, salary, season)\n",
    "3. Appending the previous column with our new data\n",
    "  * Since know which season is the culprit, will drop all rows containing the season 2005 in our original dataset\n",
    "    * We know there are only 120 players recorded in the 2005 season, so when we drop them we should have a total row count of 10356\n",
    "  * Next, we will just simply concatenate the two datasets together since we made sure that our columns match the original order\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, both our team salary and player salary data sets are tidy, with no missing or erroneous data, and are ready to for exploration and analysis."

    "## Analysis Through Data Visualization\n",
    "As we became familiar with our data sets, we came across a few items that are worth highlighting before diving into the exploratory data analysis below.\n",
    "The first is in regard to the salary data itself. The information reported online is not necessarily the salary that will end up being paid to an individual athlete rather,\n",
    "it is what the team has committed to pay in honoring the contract with the athlete. The amount actually paid by a team to a player may differ for a variety of reasons,\n",
    "and often times negotiations between teams to trade players will result in breaking and renegotiating contracts before the end of the initial contract period.\n",
    "As a result, the actual flow of money may not be exactly as represented by the stated salaries. Despite this, our team is comfortable in using the salary information\n",
    "as presented because the salary represents the full amount the team is willing to pay, assuming the contract is seen through to the end.\n",
    "Furthermore, as we are concerned with the allocations of salaries amongst teams and players, the amount committed to be paid still represents the value of each athlete to the team.\n",
    "As a result, we are comfortable continuing our analysis with the data collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another point worth noting is in regard to the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the NBA and the Players Association.\n",
    "This agreement stipulates a minimum salary and maximum salary that teams pay to players based on a variety of factors.\n",
    "The agreement sets out the salary based on these factors for the first year of the agreement and specifies the rate at which a salary may increase or decreased for the following seasons.\n",
    "These agreements are periodically reviewed and the most recent agreement took effect July 1, 2017 and is effective through the 2023-2024 season (NBPA, 2021).\n",
    "These contract limitations defined within the CBA may reduce the number and/or magnitude of extreme outliers in the data but, there is still a wide variation in salaries paid within\n",
    "the league.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final note regarding our analysis is that we examined the salaries paid by the teams to the athletes. We do not take into consideration the various other\n",
    "forms of compensation an athlete may receive through other avenues such as brand/product endorsements, appearance fees, or sponsorships. These deals can often form a\n",
    "ubstantial proportion of a high performing athlete’s income but, fall outside the scope of this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are the salaries of NBA players divided amongst the teams in the league and amongst the players within the teams?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Salary Allocation Amongst Teams\n",
    "In order to understand the bigger picture, we believe it is helpful to examine the data for the NBA over time.\n",
    "The graphs below illustrate some general information in regard to team salaries across the league over the period 1991 to 2021."

    "Each team was chosen because they represent a different financial structure and philosophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Los Angeles Lakers\n",
    "The Lakers have the most extreme discrepancy of the three franchises, with two players taking up around 50 percent of all the salary.\n",
    "Furthermore, they only have 9 players that make up over 1% of the pie. This is smaller than the Raptors which have 11 players and the\n",
    "Knicks who have 12 players above the small contract threshold. Teams mostly composed of a few expensive stars often can't afford quality\n",
    "role-players and struggle with developing an all around team. This leads to the high-salary players to carry the vast amount of responsibility\n",
    "during games and leaves the team very vulnerable to injuries, which decimated the Lakers in the previous season.\n",
    "However, the upside is that great players (when healthy) often lead to championships, especially when you have multiple stats on the same team.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Toronto Raptors\n",
    "Following the Lakers is the Toronto Raptors whose most expensive player (Pascal Siakam) takes up a lower percentage of the\n",
    "pie-chart than either Anthony Davis or LeBron James on the Lakers. Consequently, the team is more well-rounded with depth at the point-guard\n",
    "and forward positions. However, unlike the Lakers the ceiling on their success is a lot lower. This is because Pascal Siakam isn't a star but\n",
    "rather a young player who has shown promise but is not nearly fully developed. Consequently, the team is attempting to rebuild around him with\n",
    "more talented rookies and young-players (whose contracts are relatively cheap) so it is expected for their win-total to decrease and their\n",
    "salary sheet to contain multiple players with small contracts in the immediate future.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New York Knicks\n",
    "Finally, we have the New York Knicks, who have just emerged from the rebuilding stage that the Raptors are about to enter.\n",
    "Similar to the Raptors they focused on consolidating young-talent and building around an individual star rather than two.\n",
    "This shows in their salary distribution as they have the most well-rounded team of the bunch. Their best player Julius Randle only takes\n",
    "up 17.6 percent of the pie-chart, significantly less than the Lakers two-stars and Raptor Pascal Siakam. Many of the Knicks players are\n",
    "still under their cheap rookie-contracts such as RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley and Obi Toppin. These rookies are already productive and\n",
    "their low-price has allowed the Knicks to build around them with complimentary role-players. This strategy diametrically opposes the Lakers\n",
    " who focused more on high-end talent. NBA History indicates that the Knicks could have a productive regular season but quickly lose in the\n",
    " playoffs where depth is less important than having the best or most dominant player.\n",

    "### Trends\n",
    "#### Overall\n",
    "Overall we see there is a large drop in median and mean salary from 2005 and does not pick up again until about 2015. During\n",
    "this time period, the NBA has had 3 collective bargaining agreements (CBA) with its players done in 2005, 2011 and 2017.\n",
    "The fluctuations in the graph could be reflecting these CBA terms where player salary are negotiated.\n",
    "The lowest median salaries in all positions came after 2010 to 2013. The most recent NBA lockout was in 2011 which falls\n",
    "in this time frame. This reduced the number of total regular season games from 82 to 66 as players were negotiating the\n",
    "new CBA agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific\n",
    "From 2000 to 2004, the position data matches with our summary data with Centers and Power Forwards getting paid more than\n",
    "Forwards and Guards. For the next 10 years, from 2005-2015 we see that the Forwards and Guards have the highest median salary\n",
    "over the rest of the positions. As we look at the latter half our data. we see that from 2016 to 2018 the positions with the\n",
    "highest median salary switch back to Centers and Power Forwards with Forwards and Guards receding in median salary.\n",
    "Finally, from 2017 to 2021, Point Guards are seen to beat out all other positions in terms of median salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Analysis\n",
    "The swings in median salary for each position in basketball could be attributed to how the game has changed over the years and how teams\n",
    "and organizations value certain player positions. To examine this, we could look at how many minutes each position has played\n",
    "and see how that has changed over the years. We can also examine more basketball related statistics such as shot attempts or the\n",
    "pace of the game and how that has impact position choice."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We had some interesting findings when we were looking at team salaries and win percentage from the 2020-2021 season. There doesn't seem to be any\n",
    "noticeable trends between the eastern and western conference teams. Some teams with lower salaries outperformed teams with higher salaries. In general,\n",
    "it seems that the western conference teams have more wins than the western conference teams despite similar team salaries. Overall, it seems that\n",
    "higher team salaries doesn't necessarily give you a higher win percentage. To examine this further, we can take a larger sample size and look at\n",
    "a range of years comparing different eras and decades in the NBA. Also, we can add in more basketball related statistics to create a logistic regression\n",
    "model in to estimate the win percentage of a team.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regard to player position and salary over time, we saw noticeable trends and drips in the data which may be an indication of how players are valued\n",
    "in the league at the time. The NBA has evolved over time and depending on the era, organizations will prioritize different positions if they\n",
    "believe it will help them win a championship.  Looking at the position salary, a large amount of player median salaries going to the\n",
    "power forwards, shooting guards, centers and point guards, in the early 2000's. We then saw a shift towards forwards a guards between\n",
    "2007 and 2015. Finally, in the current era, we see median salary shift again dramatically to point guards, centers and power forwards while\n",
    "seeing a steep decrease in median salary for forwards and guards. Like our win percentage analysis, one thing we can do is separate our players\n",
    "into different basketball eras, and compare and contrast them to get a better understanding of what positions were valuable at the time. In combination with\n",
    "salary data, we can add in basketball statistics to build a classifier using machine learning models such as K-nearest neighbours or random forests to\n",
    "predict what salaries rookie basketballs players may make based on their position or impact on the team."
